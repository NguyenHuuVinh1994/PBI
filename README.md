# DASHBOARD PBi
## Intro

Hello, I hope you're having a good day!

When I started this job, I was immediately faced with data that had never truly been explored or cleaned, and that was a really challenging time.
It took me about two months to become familiar with the data and transform it into useful information.
Below is an overview of what I was able to accomplish.
- [Sales Overview](#sales-overview)
- [Products Overview](#products-overview)
- [Sales Performance](#sales-performance)
- [Products Performance](#products-performance)


### Sales Overview

In this **Sales Overview** section, I've provided a comprehensive picture of the retail business using key performance indicators.

You can quickly view these metrics year-over-year, by month, by store, and by product information. This data allows users to quickly identify where the most significant changes are originating from.

### Products Overview

Next, users can go to the **Products Overview** dashboard to check inventory status using the Months On Hand metric. They can also see how current stock levels compare to sales. Additionally, revenue comparisons with the previous year will help users understand if current inventory levels are impacting present revenue.

### Sales Performance

To delve deeper, users can navigate to the **Sales Performance** dashboard. Here, they can analyze KPI achievement, customer conversion rates by day and by store. There's also a detailed table below with more specific metrics for each store, providing a precise picture of what's happening at every location.

To cater to users who prefer numerical data over visuals, I've also designed an additional table with daily information for each store, allowing for flexible switching.

### Products Performance
<img width="1622" height="920" alt="Products Performance" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/88a50fda-e274-4862-92a7-b50cfea68d73" />
\n The final section of my overview is **Product Performance**. By this point, users will have identified the main reasons for changes. To provide more precision, I'll offer a clearer understanding of the strategy at each store. I've created a Top 10 Products table combined with a filter, allowing users to discover popular products within a store. This can then inform promotions or planning to introduce related products to that store.

With specific metrics like the quantity sold and weekly revenue for each product, users can determine if "this is a trending product or truly a best-seller in the store."

### Closing Remarks
Actually, these are just four basic slides from the results I produced. There are even more impressive analyses for deeper insights, but I'm unable to share too much.  
Sincerely, thank you for reading.

Thank you very much.
