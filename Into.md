### Exploratory Data Analysis
Answering some questions such as:
- Cost and revenue after the campaign?
- What is the average conversion rate?
- How effective is each channel?
### Results

- The cost versus the profit from the two main distribution channels, Facebook and Ads, is very good.

- The conversion rate at 1% - 3% daily and gross ranging from 2M to 3.5M each day is an impressive figure.

- It can be seen that with the cost and revenue for a single conversion like this, the resulting efficiency is up to 500%.

- The total cost for ads is higher than for FB, but the revenue generated is the same. Therefore, we will analyze based on metrics such as impressions, clicks, and conversions.

- Impressions on ads are four times higher than on FB, and the number of clicks is also twice as high, but the conversions are almost the same. Therefore, we will look further into the conversion rate.

- So the conversion rate and click-through rate of FB are superior to ads, indicating that the FB channel provides better profitability.

### Recommendations
- Additional information can be expanded by collecting data on age, occupation, and gender to identify the target audience for the courses. This will help in formulating policies and organizing sessions that are tailored to the specific audience.
- In case the revenue from ads decreases, we can increase the budget for the FB channel to maintain stable revenue while finding another media channel to replace it.
- Finally, with the actual profits, the academy can organize offline sharing sessions or hold competitions to enhance the influence of the academy's brand.
